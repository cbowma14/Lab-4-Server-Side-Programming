## DESCRIPTION

This project makes use of OpenWeatherMap's API to provide information about the current weather inculding temperature, description, air pressure, air humidity, and wind speed of a location based on the zip code that a user enters.

## ISSUES

I initially had a bit of trouble trying to extract the relevant data from the response to the GET request. I fixed this by ensuring that the response was parsed before extracting the data.

I had no other issues or questions arise while working on this program.
